==================================
Changes for Crate Data JDBC Client
==================================

Unreleased
==========

2018/03/22 2.3.0
================

 - Updated ``getPrimaryKeys()`` method in DatabaseMetaData to work correctly
   with CrateDB 2.3.0 and newer.

2017/08/18 2.2.0
================

 - Getting table/column metadata now retrieves the information from CrateDB's
   ``information_schema.tables`` and ``information_schema.columns`` tables
   for all SQL99 compliant fields.

 - Changed the assumeMinServerVersion default to "9.5", because CrateDB
   emulates Postgres version 9.5.
   This change eliminates initial SET SESSION statements which are ignored
   on the server-side anyway.

 - BREAKING:

   - Strict mode: The driver will no longer report that transactions are
     supported. The default transaction isolation is ``TRANSACTION_NONE``

   - Strict mode: Disabled read-only connections.

2017/04/27 2.1.7
================

 - Fix: Unsupported DatabaseMetaData methods returned a row with all values set
   to ``null`` instead of an empty result with no rows at all.

2017/03/03 2.1.6
================

 - Fix: Also shade ``org.apache`` packages in standalone jar to prevent
   collisions.

2017/02/01 2.1.5
================

 - Allow setting autocommit to false in non-strict mode.
   Autocommit must be false otherwise ``setFetchSize()`` on the statement does
   not have any effect and all rows are fetched at once.

2017/01/20 2.1.4
================

 - Re-implemented Connection#getMoreResults() method which is used by 3rd party
   application to check whether more than one ResultSet is returned.
   Since CrateDB does not support multiple results, this method will always
   return false.

2017/01/09 2.1.3
================

 - Replace only first occurrence of ``crate`` in connection string (as part of
   the protocol) when passed to PostgreSQL driver ``connect()`` implementation.
   This could have caused a connection error in case ``crate`` was part of the
   hostname.

2016/12/16 2.1.2
================

 - Fix: Do not allow connection strings that start with ``postgresql://`` or
   ``jdbc:postgresql://``
   This is important if you use both the PostgreSQL and CrateDB JDBC driver in
   the same application.

2016/11/24 2.1.1
================

 - Fix: usage of unsupported features like ``executeUpdate`` with return
   columns was not caught properly

2016/11/22 2.1.0
================

 - shaded pgsql sources to avoid dependency conflicts in projects which are
   depending on crate jdbc and postgresql jdbc driver

 - Fixed the issue which caused `getSchemas` and `getPrimaryKeys` to fail in
   Crate versions higher than 0.57.

2016/11/07 2.0.1
================

 - Fixed packaging issue which caused the inccorect resolution of the
   transitive dependencies.

2016/11/04 2.0.0
================

 - BREAKING:

   - Removed Crate client from the Crate JDBC driver. The driver uses the
     postgres wire protocol.

   - Support for the ``showsubcolumns`` parameter has been dropped.

   - The format of the connection string has been changed. The default schema
     name cannot be set via the connection string.

2016/11/04 1.14.0
=================

 - Updated Crate client to 0.56.3

 - Updated Crate JDBC metadata method supportsAlterTableWithAddColumn
   to reflect the current state of Crate.

 - Updated Crate JDBC metadata keywords methods to reflect the current
   state of Crate.

 - Updated Crate JDBC database metadata outer joins methods to reflect the
   current state of Crate.

 - Updated Crate JDBC database metadata methods getNumericFunctions, getStringFunctions
   and getTimeDateFunctions to reflect the current state of Crate.

 - Updated Crate client to 0.55.6.

 - Applications no longer need to load the Crate JDBC driver explicitly
   using `Class.forName()`.

2016/09/07 1.13.1
=================

 - Updated Crate client to 0.55.4.

 - Fix: Pacakaging of the Crate standalone JDBC driver for the versions
   which use crate-client <= 0.55.2.

2016/07/11 1.13.0
=================

 - Updated Crate client to 0.55.2.

 - Added JDBC property that allows to fetch nested columns if table metadata is queried.

 - It is now possible to set connection properties via the connection string.

2016/06/27 1.12.3
=================

 - Make jars Java 7 compatible when building with newer JDK version

2016/06/08 1.12.2
=================

 - Fix: Crate client was not closed when last JDBC connection was closed, and
   therefore caused leaking threads.

2016/05/17 1.12.1
=================

 - Set/get fetch direction and size methods no longer throw an exception.
   The methods calls are silently ignored.

2016/05/17 1.12.0
=================

 - update crate client to 0.54.9

 - make fetch size and set direction functionality compliant with the
   JDBC specification.

 - implemented the ``strict`` connection setting which enforces
   the driver to be compliant with the JDBC specification.

2016/02/08 1.11.0
=================

 - updated crate testing to 0.3.0

 - Updated Crate client to ``0.54.4``

 - use only one shared CrateClient for all connections with the same URL

================

 - Updated Crate client to ``0.51.6``

 - Fix: close JDBC connection correctly before raising exception for invalid
   URL format in order to prevent memory leak

 - Fix: URL parameters after the schema name are ignored

 - Fix: close Crate client to shut down remaining thread pools and connections
   when closing JDBC connection

   urls from none crate urls

 - Updated Crate client to ``0.50.5``

2015/07/09 1.8.1
================

 - Updated Crate client to ``0.49.5``

 - Fix: executeBatch() method on a prepared statement did not take
   custom schema from connection into account and therefore caused
   TableUnknownException

================

 - Added support for setting the QueryTimeout

2015/06/15 1.7.0
================
