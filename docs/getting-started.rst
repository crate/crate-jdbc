Prerequisites
=============

The CrateDB JDBC driver requires Java 8, preferably update 20 or later. We
recommend using `Oracle’s Java`_ on macOS and `OpenJDK`_ on Linux Systems.
Please also consult the :ref:`compatibility-notes` for additional information.

Install
=======

The driver comes in two variants, available on Maven Central at the
`repository root folder`_.

- `crate-jdbc`_

  The driver JAR, suitable to be used as a dependency in your project.

- `crate-jdbc-standalone`_

  A single, standalone JAR file, that bundles all the
  driver dependencies, suitable to be used as a plugin for tools such as
  `SQuirreL`_. This variant should not be used as a dependency in a Maven or
  Gradle project.

.. SEEALSO::

   To build the CrateDB JDBC driver from the source code, follow the
   `developer guide`_.

Set up as a dependency
======================

This section shows you how to set up the CrateDB JDBC driver as a
dependency using Maven or Gradle, two popular build tools for Java projects.

Maven
-----

Add ``crate-jdbc`` as a dependency, like so:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
            <artifactId>crate-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>2.6.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Gradle
------

If you're using `Gradle`_, you will need to add the Maven Central repository to your
``build.gradle`` file:

.. code-block:: groovy

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

Then, add ``crate-jdbc`` as a dependency:

.. code-block:: groovy

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.crate:crate-jdbc:2.6.0'
    }

Next steps
==========

Once the JDBC driver is set up, you probably want to :ref:`connect to CrateDB
<connect>`.
