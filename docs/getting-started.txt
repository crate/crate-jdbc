Getting Started
===============

This page shows you how to get started with the :ref:`JDBC driver library for
CrateDB <index>`.

.. rubric:: Table of Contents

   :local:

Install
=======

The ``crate-jdbc`` jar files are hosted on `Bintray`_ and available via
`JCenter`_.

In addition to ``crate-jdbc`` there is also a standalone version
named ``crate-jdbc-standalone`` which already includes its dependencies.

.. note:: ``crate-jdbc-standalone`` should not be used in Maven projects,
    but might want to be used e.g. as a driver for the `Squirrel`_ SQL client.

You can download the latest standalone version directly from the
`Bintray Repository`_.

Build Systems
=============

Maven Setup
-----------

If you're using `Maven`_ and you want to use ``crate-jdbc`` with your Maven
project, you need to add the Bintray repository to your ``pom.xml``:

.. code-block:: xml

    ...
    <repositories>
        ...
        <repository>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
            <id>central</id>
            <name>bintray</name>
            <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ...
    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
            <artifactId>crate-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>...</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...

Gradle Setup
------------

If you're using `Gradle`_, you can use this configuration:

.. code-block:: groovy

    repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.crate:crate-jdbc:...'
        ...
    }

Alternatively you can follow the instructions on the Bintray repository
overview page by clicking the "Set me up!" button.

Learning More
=============

Crate.io maintains a `sample JDBC application`_ that uses this library, which
may be a good starting point as you learn to use it for the first time. And be
sure to check out out the `application documentation`_.

Browse the rest of the JDBC driver library :ref:`reference documentation
<index>` for more information.
