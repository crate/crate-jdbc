Crate JDBC Driver
=================

JDBC is a core API of Java 1.1 and later. It provides a standard set of
interfaces to SQL-compliant databases.

Crate provides a type 4 JDBC driver. The driver is written in Pure Java, and
communicates in the database system's own network protocol. Because of this,
the driver is platform independent.

.. note:: This JDBC driver requires Crate version 0.38.0 or higher.


JDBC Driver Class
=================

The Crate JDBC driver class is `io.crate.client.jdbc.CrateDriver`.

JDBC URL Format
===============

With JDBC, a database is represented by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
With Crate, this takes the following form:

    crate://<host>:<transport-port>

For example::

    crate://localhost:4300
