CrateDB JDBC Driver
===================

JDBC is a core API of Java 1.1 and later. It provides a standard set of
interfaces to SQL-compliant databases.

CrateDB provides a `type 4 JDBC driver`_. The driver is written in pure Java,
and communicates with the database using the `PostgreSQL Wire Protocol`_.

.. NOTE::

   The 2.x.x releases of this library differ from the 1.x.x releases in two
   ways.

   The `connection string`_ changed to the same format as PostgreSQL JDBC,
   which means that setting the default schema with the connection string is
   not supported. Use ``setSchema()`` instead or provide a schema name in a
   SQL statement.

   Additionally, support for the experimental ``showsubcolumns`` parameter has
   been dropped.
