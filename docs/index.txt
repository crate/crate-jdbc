CrateDB JDBC Driver
===================

A `type 4 JDBC driver`_ driver for `CrateDB`_.

`JDBC`_  provides a standard set of interfaces to SQL-compliant databases, so
using this driver should feel familiar if you have used a JDBC driver before.

.. NOTE::

   This document assumes familiarity with JDBC. Consult the `JDBC
   documentation`_ for supporting material.

.. TIP::

   There is a `sample application`_ (with its own `documentation`_) that
   demonstrates the use of this library. This may be a useful reference as you
   learn to use the driver for the first time.

.. SEEALSO::

   The CrateDB JDBC Driver is an `open source`_ project and is `hosted on
   GitHub`_.
