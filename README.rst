A `JDBC`_ driver for `CrateDB`_.

JDBC is a core API for Java 1.1 and later. It provides a standard set of
interfaces to SQL-compliant databases.

This is a `type 4 JDBC driver`_. The driver is written in pure Java, and
communicates with the database using the `PostgreSQL Wire Protocol`_.

Prerequisites
=============

The CrateDB JDBC driver requires `Java 8`_, preferably update 20 or later. We
recommend using `Oracle’s Java`_ on macOS and `OpenJDK`_ on Linux Systems.

Consult the `compatibility notes`_ for additional information.

Installation
============

These instructions show you how to build the CrateDB JDBC driver from the source
code. For a conventional install, follow the `getting started`_ documentation.

Clone the repository::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/crate/crate-jdbc

Change directory into the repository::

    $ cd crate-jdbc

Build a regular JAR file::

    $ ./gradlew jar

Or, build a JAR file that includes dependencies::

    $ ./gradlew standaloneJar

Afterwards you can find the JAR file in the ``build/lib`` directory.

Contributing
============

This project is primarily maintained by Crate.io_, but we welcome community
contributions!

See the `developer docs`_ and the `contribution docs`_ for more information.
